# Caesar-Cipher
A basic python project that utilizes the ord() and char() functions to access the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) to create a cipher.

## Accomplishments
Successfully implemented python fundamentals including: 
* For Loops 
* If and Elif Statements 
* Defining Functions 

## Challenges 
Unable to implement sys package provided by instructor's guide of the project. 

## Next Steps
It would be best practice to decrease the amount of code used to create the if statements especially within the decrypt function by adding similar lines of code within the encrypt function.  Additionally, implementing more lines of code that will cipher words outside of "Secret" would be helpful when an input() function implemented, to allow users to cipher their message of choice rather than the given message.
