# Caesar-Cipher
A basic python project that utilizes the ord() and char() functions to access the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) to create a cipher.

# Accomplishments
Successfully implemented python fundamentals including: 
* For loops 
* If statements 
* Defining Functions 

# Challenges 
Unable to implement sys package provided by instructor's blueprint of the project 

# Next Steps
It would be best practice to possibly implement additional lines of code that will iterate against not only uppercase letters but lowercase as well. Additionally, implementing an input() function to allow users to cipher their message of choice rather than the given message.
